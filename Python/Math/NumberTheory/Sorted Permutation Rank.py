"""
Given a string, find the rank of the string amongst its permutations sorted lexicographically.
Assume that no characters are repeated.

Input : 'acb'
Output : 2

The order permutations with letters 'a', 'c', and 'b' :
abc
acb
bac
bca
cab
cba
The answer might not fit in an integer, so return your answer % 1000003
